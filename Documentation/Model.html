   The MIcroSimulation Tool (MIST) was derived from the Indirect
Estimation and Simulation Tool (IEST) and uses code distributed under
the IEST name. The change of the name signifies a split from the
original design that  focuses on microsimulation. For the sake of
completeness, the copyright  statement from the original tool developed
by the University of Michigan is provided below and is also mentioned

<h2 class="chapter">8 Model</h2>

<h3 class="section">8.1 Definitions of a Model</h3>

<p><strong>Model:</strong> A specification of the disease progression created by the user within the system. The progression is defined as a set of states and processes, and of transitions between these states. Transitions hold transition probabilities that describe transition from one state to another.

<h3 class="section">8.2 Working with Models</h3>

<h4 class="subsection">8.2.1 Creating a Model</h4>

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>From the main window, click the 'Models' on the left navigation pane. 
<br><br><img src='Images/model.jpg'><br><br><li>This form shows all of the studies and models in the project. To add a new study or model, press the 'Add' button (A), and a new row will appear in the table. 
<li>Give the model a name (B). 
<li>Click on the <a href="Transitions.html#Transitions">Transitions</a> button to define transitions related to the Model. Transitions of a model will hold probabilities. 
<li>Close the form or move to the next record to save the entry. This will trigger validity checking of the data entered and if no error message is displayed, then the data has been saved to memory. Note that the information is not yet saved to a file.
     </ol>

<h4 class="subsection">8.2.2 Removing a Model</h4>

<p>Open the Model form. Identify the row to be removed, and click the 'X' (delete) button for that row. This may require deletion of other entities and may be difficult if the deletion candidate was extensively used.
