   The MIcroSimulation Tool (MIST) was derived from the Indirect
Estimation and Simulation Tool (IEST) and uses code distributed under
the IEST name. The change of the name signifies a split from the
original design that  focuses on microsimulation. For the sake of
completeness, the copyright  statement from the original tool developed
by the University of Michigan is provided below and is also mentioned
